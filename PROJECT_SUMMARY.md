# Secure File Management System - Summary

## Project Overview
A secure file management system that provides encrypted storage, two-factor authentication, and malware scanning capabilities through a command-line interface.

## Key Features
1. **Security**
   - AES-256 encryption for all files
   - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
   - Malware scanning
   - Secure session management

2. **File Management**
   - Upload and download files
   - Share files with other users
   - Delete files
   - List files with detailed information

3. **User Interface**
   - Command-line interface
   - Rich terminal output
   - Serial numbering for file lists
   - Clear error messages

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup
```bash
setup.bat
```

### 2. Basic Usage
```bash
# Register
python main.py register Admin

# Login
python main.py login Admin

# Upload file
python main.py upload "path\to\file"

# List files
python main.py list

# Share file
python main.py share "filename" "username"

# Download file
python main.py download "filename" "path\to\save"

# Delete file
python main.py delete "filename"

# Logout
python main.py logout
```

## Important Notes

### Security
- 2FA is mandatory for all users
- Files are automatically encrypted
- Session expires after 24 hours
- Manual logout required

### File Operations
- Maximum file size: 100MB
- All file types supported
- Files are scanned for malware
- Sharing requires user registration

### User Experience
- Serial numbering in file lists
- QR code for 2FA setup
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Clear error messages

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows 10/11
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## File Structure

```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Login Issues
- Ensure 2FA code is correct
- Check if backup code is valid
- Verify username exists

### 2. File Operations
- Check file size limits
- Verify file permissions
- Ensure sufficient storage space

### 3. System Issues
- Check system logs
- Verify environment variables
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

## Best Practices

### 1. Security
- Keep 2FA backup codes secure
- Change password regularly
- Use logout command when done

### 2. File Management
- Regular file cleanup
- Monitor storage usage
- Keep file names organized

### 3. System Usage
- Check status before operations
- Monitor system logs
- Regular backups
